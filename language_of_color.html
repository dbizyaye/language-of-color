    <h2>About Us</h2>
    <p>
      The Language of Color is a non-profit initiative that aims at helping autistic individuals improve their ability to build and sustain relationships, giving them a chance to express themselves through art. Everyone has strengths, and the best way to learn about someone’s strengths is by getting to know who they are as a person and what they love.
    </p>
    <p>
      When serving individuals with ASD, we focus on their strengths and address areas of challenge. Our main objectives are assisting autistic individuals in acquiring novel skills and improving existing strategies, thus facilitating communication and social interaction. By reducing barriers to participation in artistic endeavors, The Language of Color helps individuals with ASD build connections and improve social skills.

    <h2>Testimonials</h2>
    <blockquote>
      “I love painting with Mr. Denys! He always has the colors I like and he taught me how to use a palette knife. I usually do three paintings every session and Dr. Denys always helps me if I’m stuck. Sometimes, we do a painting competition. Once he and I are finished painting, we reveal our paintings to each other, and everybody else votes who did a better painting. I always win!” — <strong>Leah</strong>
    </blockquote>
    <blockquote>
      “Leo likes to run a lot. He’s very active! I almost never see him sitting still and that’s what happened during our first session. He was just running around the table again and again and wasn’t painting much. At the end of the session, Denys asked what Leo’s favorite color was and I said it was red. Next time we came, he gave Leo bigger brushes and all shades of red he could find. Leo was painting for 45 minutes straight! He finished two canvases that day. He really loved it.” — <strong>Leo’s Mother</strong>

        <h3>Soffi Miller</h3>
        <p>This Spring I graduated from University of Massachusetts Amherst with a B.S. in Public Health Sciences. Since graduation, I’ve been working as a dental assistant for Be Well Primary Health Care Center. Before my focus was dentistry, I’ve always had a strong passion for art and painting. Being a part of The Language of Color gives me the opportunity to introduce what I know about art to kids with ASD. It’s an amazing learning experience on my behalf and theirs.</p>

        <h3>Elizabeth Drobot</h3>
        <p>My name is Elizabeth Drobot and I'm a fourth year student at The London School of Fashion & Design - Istituto Marangoni. Painting has been a part of my life since I can remember myself and I have a strong belief in the positive effects that art and self expression have on those who practice in it. During my most recent summer vacation, I assisted kids with ASD through The Language of Color. This opportunity allowed me to teach the kids new painting techniques and see how much interpersonal interaction is actually involved while creating art.</p>
